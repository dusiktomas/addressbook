For testing purposes, i am using mocha with superagent + should libraries.
You can check test-api file.

### API structure and usability

API is structured by defining cascading routes which should follow best practice patterns.
HTTP response codes should follow [rfc2616] principes.

All databases setup and configs depends on environment
You can run this app with setting the environment variables:
